# Particle-XPT2046
An Implementation of spapadim XPT2046 library for Particle Photon

Source: https://github.com/spapadim/XPT2046

Examples use [Adafruit_ILI9341](https://github.com/mtnscott/Adafruit_ILI9341) and [Adafruit_mfGFX](https://github.com/pkourany/Adafruit_mfGFX_IDE) libraries.

Note: SPI clock divider is set to DIV4, DIV2 tested with photon does not work.
